You said you're having strange dreams, are they good or bad or both?
Got a head full, blurry thoughts, babe
You living with the ghost
In a big house in the country, too much space and you feel trapped
Thoughts go bouncing off the walls, got no one there to watch your back

Should we start love and give this a try?
You got baggage but so do I
You got baggage but so do I
Let’s give it a try

B-A-G-G-A-G-E
Get off my back, you're killing me
Get off my back, get off my back, get off my back
I'm breaking free, I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free
