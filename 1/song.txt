You said you're having strange dreams, are they good or bad or both?
Got a head full, blurry thoughts, babe
You living with the ghost
In a big house in the country, too much space and you feel trapped
Thoughts go bouncing off the walls, got no one there to watch your back

Should we start love and give this a try?
You got baggage but so do I
You got baggage but so do I
Letâ€™s give it a try

B-A-G-G-A-G-E
Get off my back, you're killing me
Get off my back, get off my back, get off my back
I'm breaking free, I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free

This love is like a business, it could drive us both insane
Blind emotion leads to commotion
But part of me likes that game
Part of me wants the chaos, and part of me walks alone
What am I doing, who am I fooling?
What's a life spent on your own?

Should we start love and give this a try?
You got baggage but so do I
You got baggage but so do I
Lets give it a try

B-A-G-G-A-G-E
Get off my back, you're killing me
Get off my back, get off my back, get off my back
I'm breaking free, I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free

I've spent my whole life running, I've spent my whole life running from myself
I've spent my whole life running, I've spent my whole life running from myself

B-A-G-G-A-G-E
Get off my back, you're killing me
Get off my back, get off my back, get off my back
I'm breaking free, I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free (I'm breaking free!)
I'm breaking free
